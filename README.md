**Welcome to the Interactive Recycling Center Map! ðŸ¤Ÿ**

I created an interactive recycling map entirely through R in which people can track the major recycling locations in the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, and France. Data is from ENF recycling, blank map interface is from Leaflet, and hosting is from shinyapps.io. 


To use it, just go to https://vmadan.shinyapps.io/interactive-recycling-map/ and you're all set!
